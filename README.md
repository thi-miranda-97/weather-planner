# Weather-Planner üå¶Ô∏è

**Weather-Planner** is a full-stack web application that combines weather forecasting with task management. Users can search for weather conditions in any city, view detailed forecasts, and manage their tasks based on the weather. Built with **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, **Bootstrap**, and **MySQL**, this project demonstrates my skills in front-end and back-end development, API integration, and database management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or Laravel Homestead). I used XAMPP
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- MySQL
- OpenWeather API key (get it from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api))

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-planner.git
   cd weather-planner
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:

   - Import the `weather_planner.sql` file (located in the `database` folder) into your MySQL server.
   - Update the database credentials in `db.php`:
     ```php
     $host = 'localhost';
     $dbname = 'weather_planner';
     $username = 'your-db-username';
     $password = 'your-db-password';
     ```

3. **Set Up the OpenWeather API**:

   - Replace the placeholder in `getWeatherapi.php` with your OpenWeather API key:
     ```php
     $apiKey = 'your-openweather-api-key';
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Move the project folder to your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Open your browser and navigate to:  
     `http://localhost/weather-planner/index.php`

## Future Enhancements

- **Weather-Based Task Suggestions**: Automatically suggest tasks based on weather conditions (e.g., "It's sunny! Schedule an outdoor activity.").
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the app using React Native or Flutter.
- **Email Notifications**: Send weather alerts and task reminders via email.
